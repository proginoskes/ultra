short_desc: Who's talking about cancel culture?	
full_desc: From an ideological standpoint, “_ culture” constructions are extremely useful. Few concepts other than culture are as good at describing concentrism — culture pervades every level of our existence, from the personal to the large structural systems that influence the personal. In Dick Hebidge’s Subculture, the sociologist calls this perspective of culture, “culture as ‘a whole way of life’” which contrasts the “standard of excellence” model of culture (culture as the “best” things culture produces). Culture, in either respect is both the product of societies and the societies themselves. However, culture also describes a set of values, a general intention toward some product. “Western culture,” from a “standard of excellence” model might be bourgeois taste — that which selects Mozart, Beethoven, the Great American Novel, or Pablo Picasso from an array of “lesser subjects” — where from a “way of life” model it might be a way of arranging society, or a certain behavioral motif.
