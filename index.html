			<div id="long_desc">Complications set in â€” yes, complications. How many times have we heard: 'it's simple'. Nothing is simple. We live in a world where nothing is simple. Each day, just when we think we have a handle on things, suddenly some new element is introduced and everything is complicated once again. What is the secret?

As the night wind blows, the boughs move to and fro.
The rustling, the magic rustling that brings on the dark dream.

A circle of pain, a circle of suffering.
Woe to the ones who behold the pale horse.</div>
